	iomem is a tool that allows direct access to memory-mapped registers.
	In embedded systems, this can be very handy if you do not have to write
	a driver for simple tasks but can tamper with iomem directly in the memory.

	For example, to read out the 32 bit register at the address 0x12345678
	call "iomem r32 0x12345678". To read out the four 16 bit registers at
	the io address 0x100 one would execute "iomem r16-port: 4 0x100".
	There are modes to read and write on register blocks and to make several
	read or write accesses to a FIFO register.

	There is also an option to wait polling for a register to accept a
	certain bit pattern.
